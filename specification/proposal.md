## Description
Original Project Proposal - Briefcase: Portfolio Webapp for Art Majors

There are several well-established employment-based websites and SNS that showcase students’ capabilities and potentials, such as LinkedIn and GitHub. However, these platforms do not provide equivalent UI/UX to highlight art major students.

For the final project, our team is going to build a web application platform that is UI/UX friendly to art students by generating professional portfolios for them. Our intended audiences are mainly college students in several art-related fields such as Fine Art, Architecture, Music Performance, etc. Users can build their portfolios by adding their artwork on top of our built-in templates; <mark>they can drag-and-drop the components for customization.</mark>

Depending on the user’s field of study, several sample templates will be available. If a user allows, his/her artwork will become public, making it possible for other users <mark>or potential employers to view them and send comments or message to the author.</mark> ~~rate & comment on them. Potential employers will have a separate login feature and will easily be able to view a specific candidate’s portfolio.~~

<mark>There are several components in our project. Once the user has signed up or logged in, there will be a USER DASHBOARD in which the user can manage both frontend and backend of his/her portfolios. User may upload and manage their art works or media that goes onto the site on BACKEND CONTROL section of their dashboard. FRONTEND CONTROL section will allow the user to edit or customize the layout of the portfolio. User will also have an INBOX in his/her dashboard that stores messages that are sent from other users or potential employers.</mark>

Some key functionalities to address in our web app is how convenient it is for users to create <mark>and edit</mark> their professional portfolios, how easily accessible are the artworks and portfolios to other users and employers, ~~how secure their artwork would be from 3rd parties that try to duplicate or steal users’ artwork,~~ <mark>how projects are set to be private or public, how multimedia (including videos, audios, images, texts, pdfs, etc.) can be displayed on the web, how components and layouts of the portfolio can be customized, and how projects can be archived or ranked by the user.</mark>

We plan to use jQuery, ~~and D3.js.~~ <mark>Django, css libraries such as Animate.css, GSAP, etc., SASS, Gulp, and Django libraries for converting markdown to html / uploading and displaying media files. Also plotly will be used to display graphs.</mark>
